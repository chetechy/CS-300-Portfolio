# CS-300-Portfolio
These projects required me to write code to make computer science programs print out in the correct order. Project One was my starting point for Project Two. I was able to resolve most of the issues I faced throughout this semester by consulting the course material provided to me via ZyBooks or external sources such as YouTube, codecademy, and stack overflow. I applied that principle to my roadblocks as well since they are basically the same thing and require the same solution. Through this project, I gained a different perspective on software design and discovered multiple avenues of approaches I can use in the future. As a result, I became more comfortable with the idea of taking on something challenging. Because I know I'll be doing this for a company or multiple companies one day, I always aim to create projects that are readable, maintainable, and adaptable as possible. To me, simplicity is key, and there's no need to complicate anything if you don't need to. The importance of data structures lies in their ability to fit the environment that requires them. If you don't know the importance of each one and how to utilize them, you might end up making a lot more work for yourself that ultimately fails.
